Stardate - 4/5/22

It has been almost two months since I began my research into basic compiler construction and language design. I gave up halfway on trying to read "Compiler Construction" (1996, Waite and Goos) as it was a bit outdated and I had a hard time understanding a lot of the examples as they were primarily using older languages like COBOL, and Fortran. This text was also very theory heavy, and while I know a bit of set theory, a lot of it went over my head and wasn't very useful (and very hard to parse in the first place). Instead, I read "Introduction to Compilers and Language Design" (2020 Thain) which was a much better experience as it was more implementation based and less focused on describing the various types of grammers in mathematical notation.

But now, having a (very) basic knowledge of language construction, I feel empowered enough to create the world's best programming language and no-one can stop me.
More importantly, though, I have finally decided on a name:
**SIGIL**
Why? Becuase it's cool, obviously. And it's simple, easy to remember, and fits the theme of BDD pretty nicely. Also, most importantly, it's not already taken by an exisiting language. 

The first thing I should do next is start figuring out Sigil's grammer. I have ideas on some basic things, but I haven't nailed down the specifics yet. I will also need to start working on a formal definition of the language, which means I need to start writing some BNF to describe it's structure.
