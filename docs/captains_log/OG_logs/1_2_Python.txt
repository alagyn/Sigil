
Over the past year, I have written a lot of code in Python (too much Python) and despite how much
power a very high-level lang gives you, I still find it to be lacking in some ways. In particular,
I dislike it for much the same reasons that I find JavaScript to be a terrible language: weakly-typed variables.
While an argument can be made that typeless variables and arguments improve code readability and reduces
typing (the kind you do with your fingers), in the end I find it harms the developer more-so when they cannot 
easily discern the type of an object without manually checking it (which in the end adds more code). I find this especially
annoying when using 3rd party libraries and they either:
  1) Don't use type hints
  2) did complicated things with packages and whatnot, breaking any IDE's ability to find the types
  3) Poorly document their API and expected argument types
  
No to mention that IDE's will struggle with any static error checking and also have a tendancy
to tell me an argument is the wrong type or even that it doesn't exist, but then the code still runs as expected.

A list of other things I dislike about Python
* lack of true public/private class members
* lack of true abstract classes/interfaces
* lack of true enums
* lack of true const values
* manually specifying "self" for EVERY class variable and method declaration and usage
* lack of true multithreading
* the whole no curly brackets thing is meh and causes more issues when autoformatting if nothing else
* why is True and False capitalized?
* lack of true multi-line comments, like... why?
* "elif" ...need I say more 

Despite this, there are still quite a lot of things I DO like about python
* simplicity in creating new projects/package structure
* list comprehensions (obviously... who doesn't abuse these?)
* simple operator/keyword overloading
* keyword only arguments
* functions as first-class objects
* lists, dicts, and sets as standard language constructs
* the freakin print func is always available and not "System.out.println()" or ""cout << nonsense"
* F strings
* array slicing
* ternary if-else using keywords
