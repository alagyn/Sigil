Now, most importantly... this language of mine is going to need a name. Those of you who know me, know that names are very important.
It has to be the just right combination of coolness, memorability, and potentially puns.

Current name ideas
  Wyvern, .wy - sadly already taken, but I've been saving this one for a while
  
  Jumble
    Jumbalaya, .jm - bit wordy, but memorable. On theme for the jumble of inspiration languages
    Hydra, .hy - good, kinda like Python, on theme again for more than one head
    Amalgam, .am - mouthful?
    Cerberus, .cb
    
    
  Brain Dead Dev 
    Skeleton/Skelly, .sk
    LichScript, .ls 
    Salamander, .sl
    Mimic, .mc
    Spectre, .sp
    
    
  Misc
    WolfScript, .ws - NCSU themed I guess, memorable. Could really add Script to the end of any word
    Atlas, .at - greek names always cool
