This log will contain what books I am reading as well as my thoughts on them.

To start off with, I am reading: "Compiler Construction" by William M. Waite and Herhard Goos.
    Free PDF: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aplatzer/course/Compilers/waitegoos.pdf (372 pages)
    This text is a bit dated by now (1995), but it seems to have a strong base in the theory and should prove useful.
    I have given up on this one. Far too theoretical.

Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools. (Second Edition). Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman. ISBN: 0-321-48681-1
    (2007) looks... thorough, probably a useful one (1038 pages)

"Introduction to Compilers and Language Design" by Douglas Thain
    Free PDF: https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/
    More modern (2020) and potentially a bit more implementation focused (247 pages)
	This one has been rather useful and provided a good amount of concrete examples for testing my automata

Programming Language Pragmatics. (Third Edition). Michael L. Scott. ISBN: 978-0-12-374514-9.
(2009) Looks about the same as the last one (940 pages)
