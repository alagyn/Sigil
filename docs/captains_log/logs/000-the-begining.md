Stardate - 2/14/2022

Today marks the day that a new adventure will start. I am a fresh college grad and am on the hunt for employment, but in the meantime, I have a new project: creating my own programming language. Suffice it to say that this is not a trivial objective. Desite how many programmers there are, I'd say very few have ever had to ever care about *how* the languages they are using are actually constructed. I myself only know the basics. I had wanted to take an elective on compilers during college, but it never worked out with my schedule meaning this project will be entirely self taught. I will try to set my expectations low, I do not expect to create the next great thing, but I want to challenge myself with this. I have a tendency to never finish projects, but I intend to keep working on this until I have *something* resembling a working product.

But first, some initial musings on what I want to make.

I intend to create a language that is the ultimate combination of the things I like about the 3 languages I use the most:
1) Python
2) Java
3) C++

If you know your languages, then you know that these are all within the same approximate family:
* Procedural, Functional, and Object Oriented
* Syntax is heavily C based
* Generic (i.e., not field specific like R, Matlab, etc)

In terms of the "level" of these languages, however, they are obviously all over the place: Python is very high, C++ is low, and Java is somewhere in the middle. They also differ in runtime, with C++ being compiled, Python is interpreted, and Java once again somewhere in the middle doing a bit of both. I will need to think about how my language will be run as they all have their pros and cons. but I am leaning towards something similar to Jave if possible, but at the bare minimum having a machine code compiler.

The first steps for this project will primarily be education and planning. I have practically no concrete experience with writing compilers, but I have a good amount of general knowledge and familiarity with automata and grammer definition. I will need to find some good learning materials before I can even begin writing any code.

THE BIG THINGS:
* Strongly Typed
* True multithreading support
* Clean interface for embedding in C++
* Python-like iteration
* Java-like packages
* Cpp-like threads
